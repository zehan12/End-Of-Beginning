# The only shortcut to life is to never miss a day. because sometimes you get lucky. and you'll never miss a lucky day. if you try every day.

<i>And yet we will always believe
that there is a way</i>

<i>to turn the tide in our favor.
If we only want it hard enough.</i>

<i>Man is able to pursue any goal,
no matter how unattainable it may seem,</i>

<i>over the course of an entire lifetime.</i>

<i>No resistance, no obstacle is great enough</i>

<i>to stop the human will in its tracks.</i>

<i>Isn't this stubbornness in our striving</i>

<i>what distinguishes us from animals
that know only short-term desire?</i>

<i>And throughout the ages,
is not this unquenchable thirst</i>

<i>at the heart of any progress
that is ever made?</i>

<i>No matter what motivates our will,</i>

<i>it guides us on our path.</i>

<i>We will only be able to let go</i>

<i>once we've reached our goal.</i>
